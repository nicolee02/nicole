		        <p><b><h2>This is my first game. I created it in Scratch. Scratch used block code, and you can create stories, games, and more using Scratch. My game is called Bust Down D-Money. To Play: 
1. Press the flag to begin.
2. Use the mouse to control the trampoline so that the person jumps on the trampoline each time. 
3. As you pass through the levels the speed of the person will increase.
4. Touch the yellow star for bonus points.
5. If you touch the lava then you die. This is the first coding project we have done and it was a little difficult to get a hang of the program at first. However, as time went on it was much easier.</h2></b></p>

<p><b><h2>This is a game I created in MIT App Inventor. You can create cooler things with MIT App Inventor than Scratch because you use a tablet to run the app you make. This makes it so your app can be touch screen and vibrate. MIT App Inventor also uses block code. My app is Tic Tac Toe. It vibrates every time someone wins or loses. It also plays music throughout the game and switches the type of music when someone wins.To play the game you need two players. One player is X and the other is O. Each player alternates taking turns, and to win you need to get three in a row. MIT App Inventor was very difficult to use, especially in the beginning. It was hard to find some of the blocks I needed to create my game. Also, at first the game did not work when we put our code in, and we had to go through and figure out what was wrong. Eventually we figured it out and were able to successfully make a game.</h2></b></p>
