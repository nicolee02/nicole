		        <p><b>This is my first game. I created it in Scratch. It is called Bust Down D-Money. To Play: 
1. Press the flag to begin.
2. Use the mouse to control the trampoline so that the person jumps on the trampoline each time. 
3. As you pass through the levels the speed of the person will increase.
4. Touch the yellow star for bonus points.
5. If you touch the lava then you die. </b></p>
